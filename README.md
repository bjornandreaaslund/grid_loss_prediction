# grid_loss_prediction
A power grid transports the electricity from power producers to the consumers. But all that is produced is not delivered to the customers. Some parts of it are lost in either transmission or distribution. In Norway, the grid companies are responsible for reporting this grid loss to the institutes responsible for national transmission networks. They have to nominate the expected loss day ahead to the market so that the electricity price can be decided.  The physics of grid losses are well understood and can be calculated quite accurately given the grid configuration. Still, as these are not known or changes all the time, calculating grid losses is not straight forward.
